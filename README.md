# Concurrent Filter profile analysis

A simple profiler for filters implemented using different concurrency libraries.  

A few simple filters with varying numbers of parameters will be made.

This is still very much a work in progress and written mainly to practice concurrent filter implementations.

I should add a Fourier transform and inverse fourier transform here also and get rid of the 'std::vector' dependence.
